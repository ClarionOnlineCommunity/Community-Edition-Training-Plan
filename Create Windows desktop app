Might be worth doing a clarion centric version of this?

Legal Data Privacy considerations.
As the world becomes smaller with improved communications, Govt's around the world are waking up to the publics demand for better legal controls handling their data.
Being aware of the legal data handling considerations for your intended markets and terrorties is now part of the process when designing apps. 
Part of the data handling considerations will involve understanding security measures which can be built into an app, the understanding of encryption algorithms and 
the limitations of security measures at the hardware level, operating system and app level. There's not much point developing an app if you thought some security measure was
handled by another part of the network/system when it wasnt. In addition some encryption methods could require Govt licencing before export licences can be granted.
This will vary depending on what country you live in and how they view users at home and abroad. So if encryption is to be used, be sure you stay legal with its use in your country.

Is it possible to put Clarion specific examples in the MS SDK-API to broaden the reach of Clarion or is that toooooo cheeky?
https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/01/21/making-win32-apis-more-accessible-to-more-languages/

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/apiindex/api-index-portal
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/apiindex/windows-api-list

eg by getting Clarion examples added maybe from this account into the Windows github posts like these?
So show Clarion code here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/windowsx/nf-windowsx-button_enable
edit it here?
https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/sdk-api/blob/docs/sdk-api-src/content/windowsx/nf-windowsx-button_enable.md

If the above is possible, it would increase the exposure of Clarion in a large way!!!
