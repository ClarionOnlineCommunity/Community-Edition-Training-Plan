So to get the most out of Clarion, sometimes its best to step back and admire everything it has to offer.
So like all major programming languages, its got an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which is customisable and extendable.

The Clarion runtime (licence free) is data centric, making it quick and easy to manage data in various locations.

Clarion ships with Templates to make the generation and management of your program code, data & management, the most efficient IDE for coding & data management in the world. 
                                                            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarion_(programming_language)#Use_of_templates

Clarion is a tool where you can roll your sleeves up and really have it working for you if you need to leverage more intelligence or AI into the IDE.                                                            



Working with the Templates.
Out the box, most clarion developers start in the dictionary (DCT), this is where you import your database tables from data sources, set preferences for columns (fields) which controls 
what can be displayed or used in the program, add in other functionality into a column's properties and then "wizard" up an app. Thats its. One prototype to edit your data source is ready.
At this stage, you can start tweaking, customising your app to shape it into a finished product. Have the backend data logic seperation you need by swapping dct table drivers.

You really are only limited by your own imagination and skillset when it comes to working with Clarion to produce your applications.
